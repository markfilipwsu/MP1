Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and line it with parchment paper so that it hangs over two sides to make it easy to life the brownies out of the pan when baked.","Melt the chocolate with butter in a medium heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water, or you will burn the chocolate. Whisk until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and add sugars into the chocolate mixture and whisk until completely combined. Let the chocolate mixture cool for a few minutes. ","Add in eggs and vanilla, and beat with a hand mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. This will ensure that the brownies have a classic crinkly top.","Add in flour, cocoa powder, and salt and fold together using a large silicone spatula until just combined. Transfer the thick batter into the prepared baking pan.","Bake for 25-30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean with moist a few moist crumbs attached. Bake for 25 minutes for a super fudgy brownie, bake for 30 minutes for a more cakey texture.","Once the brownies are done, remove the baking pan from the oven and place it on a wire cooling rack. Once cooled completely, lift it out of the pan and cut into squares. Or grab a spoon and enjoy it hot out of the pan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."]}]';
